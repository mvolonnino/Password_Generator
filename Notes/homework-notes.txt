Homework 3 PW Generator

    
    <textarea> = .value in Javascript
    
    function greet(name) {
    console.log("hello " + name)
  }
   
   greet(John)

   **- name is a parameter of the function, it is what is used at the time of declaration. 
   - John is the arguement is the value supplied for the parameter** 

   return is a keyword that will return that value to initalize a variable
  
  .preventDefault() — when youse event “click” to keep the information that has been entered - might need that for PW generator

  Use .split(“”) as that will take each character in the array which will be needed to pick each     character at random for password generator 

  —RUT / JS 04 Web APIs ex. 14 as good example

  passwordText.value = password; *hint for possible JS code

  having a variable = to empty array [] allows to push information to store as that variable
